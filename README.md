# course project

This is a basic structure for a website for a fictional sustainability organization, developed during an HTML, CSS and Javascript course at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. It also implements JQuery plugins and animations.

The website has the following parts:

* Login and Register pages, where the data of the user is stored temporally in the browser.
* Home page which uses the JQuery [pagePiling](https://alvarotrigo.com/pagePiling/#page2) plugin (so the rest of the sections of the website can be accessed by scrolling or by URL). It also contains multimedia elements, such as a video.
* Page containing a sustainability-related news feed, which can link to the full articles.
* Contact page where the user can submit a data sheet with their personal information.
